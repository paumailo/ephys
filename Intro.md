# Introduction #

This is a new project to develop a robust, powerful, and dynamic Matlab toolbox for designing, running, and analyzing electrophysiology experiments.  This toolbox integrates with Tucker-Davis Technologies ([tdt.com](http://www.tdt.com)) proprietary software and real-time stimulus generation and data acquisition hardware while leveraging computational power of MATLAB.  Furthermore, EPhys toolbox integrates with MySQL to create a hierarchical database of collected data and stimulus/response parameters and values.

This project is in its infancy and is actively being developed and expanded to include software developed to run electrophysiolgy, behavior (operant conditioning and other paradigms), and combined behavior/electrophysiology experiments in conjunction with TDT software.

This project is handled by a subversioning system which can be accessed with software such as [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net).
